# 🌟 Detection of Bank Transaction Anomalies Using Gradient Boosted Federated Learning 🌟

---

## 📚 Abstract

Official implementation of 'Detection of Bank Transaction Anomalies using Gradient Boosted Federated Learning' (IEEE Access). Explore cutting-edge privacy-preserving techniques, scalable federated learning models, and advanced anomaly detection algorithms for financial transactions.

### 🛠️ Overview
Fraudulent transactions pose critical challenges for the banking sector, affecting customer trust and financial security. In this research, we propose an innovative **Federated Learning framework** integrated with **Gradient Boosting algorithms** to enhance anomaly detection. Our approach ensures robust privacy-preserving mechanisms while delivering high accuracy on imbalanced datasets.
